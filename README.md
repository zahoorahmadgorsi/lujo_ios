Lujo comes from a demand for the exceptional. In the high-pressured time pressed lifestyles of today, itâ€™s sometimes hard to appreciate the possibility that exists. Lujo was pioneered and created by a team of high flyers, from the world of business, technology and beyond. It came from an idea that the role of a personal assistant and concierge can be redefined. Rather than being about us, Lujo is about you.
